  title: FRAIHMWORK Health And Integrity API
  description: 'FRAIHMWORK allows for multiple implementations of basic health and integrity monitoring services for other systems in a given network. This set of APIs are for systems that elect to do HTTP POST calls to push their state and fault information to the FRAIHMWORK platform, rather than hosting their own server endpoint or TCP/UDP streams. This initial version does not imply any protections against malicious behavior from trusted endpoints. This API will versioned according to SemVer 2.0 rules (as described here: https://semver.org/)'

    Fault:
      type: object
      description: A fault describes a specific condition that is adversely affecting the reporting system or subsystem. FRAIHMWORK uses this information to alert maintainers of problems, or to integrate various faults to identify larger system of system problems. Faults are identified by FRAIHMWORK by their name, code and source. Therefore there are assumptions to how faults are reported that should be abided by. Namely - each unique fault should have the same name and code information. Updates to the same fault should be reusing these keys, but can allow for other properties to change over time. If a fault is no longer active, it is expected that the system provides an update notifying FRAIHMWORK that the fault has been cleared. Otherwise, the fault will automatically clear after a default time interval if there have been no updates.

        severity:
          type: string
          description: |
            This is a high level description of a fault affecting the service or system
            LOW is meant for faults that have no effect on the system. These are minor oddities that the software keeps track of but do not affect service quality in any way.
            MEDIUM level faults are meant for faults that affect the system's operational performance but do not affect the quality of information provided by a service. If a service is providing trustworthy information at a suboptimal rate, or if only non-critical functions are impeded, then a service is experiencing a MEDIUM level fault
            HIGH level faults affect service quality in some way because of a malfunction of the underlying software or hardware. These faults may resolve themselves over time, but should be associated with a FAULTED state. Services experiencing a HIGH level fault are operating below their performance specifications and are likely putting out bad data that cannot be trusted
            UNKNOWN is a level reserved for when the system cannot determine the source of a fault. This should not be used generally, as other services should treat UNKNOWN faults with the same level of caution as HIGH level faults
