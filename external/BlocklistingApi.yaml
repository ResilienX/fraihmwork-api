  title: Blocklisting API
  description: 'A tool in the arsenal of fault mitigation is the ability to blocklist systems that are faulted and/or are putting out bad data. Systems downstream that rely on this system''s output could begin to enter an error state if they consume this bad data. Therefore, we can use blocklisting as a tool to limit the effect of bad actors in the system by informing downstream systems to not listen to their data feeds until the underlying problems are resolved. This API will versioned according to SemVer 2.0 rules (as described here: https://semver.org/)'
