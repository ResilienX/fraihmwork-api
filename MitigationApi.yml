        RECOMMENDED describes a mitigation action that was recommended to an end user, but is waiting for further instruction. Generally, from here the state can only change to 'ACCEPTED', 'REVOKED' or 'DENIED'
        ACCEPTED describes an action that has been accepted by a user or system, but has not yet been executed. From here, the state should only change to 'STARTED', 'REVOKED', or 'FAILED'
        STARTED describes an action that has been started and is still in progress. From herer, the state should only change to 'COMPLETE' or 'FAILED'
        COMPLETE describes an action that has been full resolved. This is an end state for the action
        FAILED describes an action that was unsuccessful in completing its task or its completion resulted in an unsatisfactory mitigation. This is an end state for the action
        REVOKED describes an action that the issuing system can no longer take or no longer desires to take. It effectively cancels the action, and is an end state.
        DENIED describes an action where a system or user has declined to allow the action to take place. It is an end state for the action
